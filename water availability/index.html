      <p>
        One of the most pressing national and global issues is the availability
        of freshwater due to global climate change, energy scarcity issues and
        the increase in world population and accompanying economic growth.
        Estimates of water supplies and flows through the world's hydrologic
        cycle and their spatiotemporal variability indicate an impending world
        crisis. Increasing use of water due to population and associated
        economic growth pressures, are creating water shortages in many parts of
        the U.S. that are projected to have population increases in the next 25
        years. Scarcity of energy resources results in the increasing use of
        alternative fuels, some of which require enormous water withdrawals for
        fuel processing. Increasing regional and global temperatures is causing
        loss of freshwater supplies due to increased evapotranspiration and
        reduced recharge of underground drinking water supplies. Agriculture is
        the dominant component of human water use, accounting for almost 70% of
        all water withdrawals. Many factors significantly impact increasing
        water demand in Oklahoma, including population growth, economic growth,
        technological development, land use and urbanization, rate of
        environmental degradation, government programs, climate change, and
        others. Water demand management is the realistic way forward. Climate
        change adds further risks and uncertainties to the picture requiring the
        adoption of adaptive management strategies for water resource
        sustainability. Sustainable development is defined as the use of ground
        water and surface water in a manner that can be maintained for an
        indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or
        social consequences.
